FURTHER GAMES AND GRAPHICS CONCEPTS - a simple engine 
This is a engeine created for a my unervisity assignment. It has been created with C++ and DirectX 11.

Sem1-
The framework is made up of two different scenes, the user will enter on the menu and then from there would be able to get to the game level.
Menu:
Click on one of the words which are textured boxes to enter or exit the application. The two clickable objects allow for the user to play and exit the application. There are also multiple cameras to allow the user to see the boxed from different viewpoints. These cameras are all static. 

Controls:
•	LMB-Click on object
•	Numpad 0- Change to camera 0
•	Numpad 1- Change to camera 1
•	Numpad 2- Change to camera 2
•	Numpad 3- Change to camera 3
•	Numpad 4- Change to camera 4

Game Level:
Control the tank to move around the level. There are three different cameras within this level. The fist allows the user to follow the tank in third person and the second allows the user to follow the tank in first person. The last camera allows for the user to fly around the level with a free cam.

Controls:
•	Up- move object along z axis
•	Down- move object along z axis
•	Left- rotate object to the left
•	Right- rotate object to the right
•	Insert- move object along x axis
•	Delete- move object along x axis
•	Numpad 0-change to third person camera 
•	Numpad 1-change to first person camera
•	Numpad 2-change to free cam

Free cam controls:
•	Up- move up the z axis
•	Down- move down the z axis
•	Left- strafe left on x axis
•	Right-strafe right on x axis
•	Insert-rotate camera left
•	Delete- rotate camera right
•	Home - rotate camera up
•	End – rotate camera down
•	Numpad 9- move up on the y axis
•	Numpad 8- move down on the y axis


Sem2-
This engine is to do more with phyiscs of a application this uses a Particle (point mass) physics model and a Rigid body physics model.
Controls:
Number:
•	1- start collision test 1(cube hitting angled plane)
•	2- start collision test 2(two cubes moving into each other)
Object controls:
•	W-thrust object 1 up
•	A-thrust object 1 left
•	S- thrust object 1 down
•	D- thrust object 1 right
•	Q-stop object 1 thrust
Camera Controls:
•	Up- move camera forward
•	Down- move camera back
•	Left- move camera left
•	Right-move camera right
Mouse controls: 
•	Left mouse button- rotate camera 
•	Right mouse button- select object
